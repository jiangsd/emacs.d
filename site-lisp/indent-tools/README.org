* indent-tools

[[https://melpa.org/#/indent-tools][file:https://melpa.org/packages/indent-tools-badge.svg]]

Indent,  move around  and  act  on code  based  on indentation  (yaml,
python, jade, etc).

Meant for indentation-based  languages, but can be used  any time with
indented text.

_Example:_

Navigating by blocks:

#+BEGIN_HTML
 <img src="https://gitlab.com/emacs-stuff/indent-tools/raw/master/demo.gif" </img>
#+END_HTML

_Indenting_:

#+BEGIN_HTML
 <img src="https://gitlab.com/emacs-stuff/indent-tools/raw/master/demo-indent.gif" </img>
#+END_HTML

** Installation

Set up [[http://wikemacs.org/wiki/Package.el][MELPA]] and use [[http://wikemacs.org/wiki/Package.el][package.el]]: =M-x package-install RET indent-tools RET=.

** Usage

You can activate a minor mode or use an [[https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra/][Hydra]].

We  recommand you  to use  the hydra  because it  shows all  available
options and it allows to call an  action multiple times in a row, with
a single keypress:
: M-x indent-tools-hydra/body

To bind the Hydra at =C-c >=:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'indent-tools)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c >") 'indent-tools-hydra/body)
#+END_SRC

To bind this in python-mode:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'python-mode-hook
 (lambda () (define-key python-mode-map (kbd "C-c >") 'indent-tools-hydra/body))
)
#+END_SRC
(=C-c >= originally bound to indent the line).

With the minor mode (=M-x indent-tools-minor-mode=), the prefix key is
at     =C-c      >=     (you      can     change      the     variable
=indent-tools-keymap-prefix=).   See   its    keymap   with   =C-h   f
indent-tools-minor-mode=.

*** Indent, de-indent

Indent an  indentation tree: =M-x indent-tools-demote=.   This indents
according to  the major  mode (currently specially  supported: python,
jade,     yaml.     For     other     modes,     it     indents     by
=indent-tools-indent-offset=, 4 spaces).

With the hydra, repeat this action as much as you wish.

Indent by only *one space* (useful for jade-mode): =SPC= key with the hydra.

Indent  the *paragraph*:  =M-x indent-tools-indent-paragraph=,  or =P=
with the hydra.

See also: (de)indenting until the end of the current indentation level
(i.e., indent every nodes with the same level).

*** Move around

 Move to the *end of the current indentation*,

 to the *next* or the *previous sibling* (a line with the same indentation),

 move  *one parent  up* or  the  first *child  down* (line  with lesser  or
 greater indentation), much useful for a  large yaml file, but also for
 code navigation.

 *j* and *k* (with the hydra) as usual go to the next and previous line.

*** Recenter screen (L)

While you  move around, you may  want to recenter the  screen, what we
usually do with =C-l= ("recenter-top-bottom"). We can not bind control
keys into hydras,  so this is bound to =L=.  Successive calls will put
the point in the middle, at the top or at the bottom of the screen.

*** Kill, copy, (un)comment, select, fold

See the  hydra.

Some actions (kill, copy, comment) will  ask you again what to operate
upon: the indented block, the whole level, or the paragraph.

Other actions (toggle fold) act straight away on the indented block.

So one can:

- kill something
- copy
- comment
- uncomment (only a paragraph)
- toggle the fold (of the current indentation)
- call imenu to go to another function definition, keeping the hydra.


There are interactive functions too:

 : M-x indent-tools-kill-[hydra/body, tree, level, paragraph]

 Copying:

 : M-x indent-tools-copy-[hydra/body, tree, level, paragraph]


*** Undo

The hydra  binds =_= to =undo-tree-undo=,  so we can try  commands and
undo anything by staying inside it.

** Configure

To   know  the   indentation   of  the   current   major  mode,   call
=indent-tools-indentation-of-current-mode=.

If   it   doesn't   know   the  current   mode,   see   the   variable
=indent-tools-indentation-of-modes-alist=.   It  is   an  alist  which
associates a mode to a  function which returns the desired indentation
level (an int).

If   no  indentation   level  is   known  for   this  mode,   it  uses
=indent-tools-indentation-offset=,    which    defaults   to    Emacs'
=standard-indent=.

Example:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun indent-tools-indentation-of-python ()
  "Return Python's current indentation as an int, usually 4."
  (cond ((and (boundp 'python-indent-offset)
              (numberp python-indent-offset))
         python-indent-offset)))

;; The alist.
(setq indent-tools-indentation-of-modes-alist
      '(
        (python-mode . indent-tools-indentation-of-python)
        (yaml-mode . indent-tools-indentation-of-yaml)
        (jade-mode . indent-tools-indentation-of-jade)
       ))
#+END_SRC

** Develop

To run the unit tests, go into the tests file and run *ert*:
: M-x ert
and either choose a specific test, either keep =t= to run all.

You'll have an ert buffer with passing tests in green, failing ones in
red. Use TAB end ENTER in this buffer (Ã  la org-mode).

** Ideas, todos

[X] Demote.

[X] Indent according to mode. Done for python, yaml and jade.

[X] Do something with the default  behaviour of =M-x indent-rigidly= which
lets us indent  interactively. Would be useful for  jade templates. =>
just used the Hydra feature.

[X] See if  the utilities functions  of mine  on [[https://gitlab.com/emacs-stuff/my-elisp/blob/master/yaml-utils.el][yaml-utils]] can  be useful
(indent all siblings at once ? Move around siblings ?).

See `move-text` in melpa to move regions up and down.

[X] See how [[https://github.com/zenozeng/yafolding.el/blob/master/yafolding.el][yafolding]] did.

** Change log

- <2018-01-24 mer.> simplify  =Kill=: it kills the  indented block, no
  more choice  to kill a  paragraph or all the  level in a  hydra, not
  fitting in this package.
- <2017-08-03 jeu.> =L= insteal of =C-l= to recenter the screen ("recenter-top-bottom").
- <2017-07-21 ven.> undo-tree within the hydra (press "_")
- <2017-07-21 ven.> small  fix for ">" indent: go to  the beginning of text before action.
- <2017-03-22 mer.> added Uncomment the paragraph
